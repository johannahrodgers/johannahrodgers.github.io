On Zoom, Everyone is a Homonym

Ideas and words.  What else is there?
Sounds.  Pretensions.  Fashion.  
Lots of other things that I don’t have time to mention.

Basically everything in the world that has been made
Or thought of.  In real time, 
The essence overall.  Sometimes.

I will write to you by talking on a pen.  Super!
Misunderstanding will be a thing of the past
As the machines control the language

You use and think in.  I love you means
A perfect 10 in Professional Ice Skating Terms.
Please don’t forget the Zamboni when you say goodnight.


The AI Chronicles [Puppet Show Theme Song Lyrics  (for the Music, Use a Casio Produced Emulation of the Tonal Framework of “I Love LA”)]

Nobody understands it
Cause it may not really exist
But no one can stop talking about it
Cause it is on everyone’s lips.

Though that may make no sense
It is often the way
Common knowledge gets created
Despite what “they” say.

The artificial and intelligence are
Both topics of vast proportions
But put side by side
They appear to be first cousins

They’re not, but it takes 
A strong reader and a canny genealogist
To explain how they are NOT related
Let’s ask Aristotle.  Isn’t he your “cardiologist”?

But however confusing
The journey is worth pursuing
Cause at the end of the day
AI is most likely here to stay (at least for a while until the name changes)



Social Security

Social Security
Is it a state of mind?
Or some magican realm 
That some of us will find

And inhabit before the 
U.S. deficit is so high
That the program can no 
Longer be funded?

Are crutches free?  Do
Mechanical tricycles draw
Couples closer together?
Will you decorate yours with 
An American flag?


Sad Songs About Climate Change: Winter

The weather is changing
There is no more snow
Where did it go?
Oh, where did it go?

Is it like some old fad,
The Chia Pet, for instance,
Or more like a trans-generational shift?
Like cars replacing horses?

In the end, does it matter
If we can or cannot 
Come up with the right
Simile and/or metaphor?
